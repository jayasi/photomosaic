photomosaic-
=======

This project was made for the Image Analysis course at IIIT - Delhi. 
For a given image, and a given set of images, one can create a coloured or a gray-scale mosaic of the set size. You can also create the mosaic from one image which would be used repeatedly. 

You would need to install the latest version of EMGU-CV and copy the dll files in the bin folder of the project.
